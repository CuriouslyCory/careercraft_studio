- `ExperienceCategory` - Types of experience requirements
- `EducationLevel` - Normalized education levels

### New Models âœ…

- `Skill` - Canonical skill definitions
- `SkillAlias` - Alternative skill names
- `SkillSimilarity` - Skill relationships (AWS â†” Azure)
- `UserSkill` - Enhanced user skill tracking
- `JobSkillRequirement` - Normalized job skill requirements
- `ExperienceRequirement` - Structured experience requirements
- `EducationRequirement` - Normalized education requirements

## Implementation Steps âœ… ALL COMPLETED

### Step 4: Create API Endpoints âœ…

- **Compatibility Router** (`/api/compatibility`) - Analyze user compatibility with job postings
  - `analyze` - Full compatibility analysis for a job posting
  - `analyzeMultiple` - Batch analysis for multiple job postings
  - `getCompatibilityScores` - Lightweight scoring for job lists
- **User Skills Router** (`/api/userSkills`) - Manage user's skills
  - `list` - Get all user skills with details
  - `add` - Add new skills to user profile
  - `update` - Update skill proficiency and experience
  - `remove` - Remove skills from profile
  - `searchSkills` - Search and autocomplete skill names
  - `getSimilarSkills` - Find similar skills for recommendations

### Step 5: Update Job Posting View âœ…

Enhanced `job-postings-panel.tsx` with:

- **Compatibility Analysis Button** - Added to each job posting row
- **Compatibility Report Modal** - Detailed analysis display with:
  - Overall compatibility score with color-coded progress bar
  - Summary statistics (perfect/partial/missing matches)
  - Strong points and improvement areas
  - Detailed skill-by-skill breakdown with color coding:
    - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Perfect match (90%+ score)
    - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Partial match (40-89% score)
    - ðŸ”´ Red: Missing requirement (0-39% score)
  - Experience and education analysis
  - Actionable recommendations

### Step 6: Add User Skill Management âœ…

Created `UserSkillsPanel` component with:

- **Skill Search & Autocomplete** - Find skills from database
- **Add New Skills** - Support for both existing and custom skills
- **Proficiency Management** - Set and update skill levels
- **Experience Tracking** - Record years of experience
- **Skill Categories** - Organized by type (Technical, Soft Skills, etc.)
- **Summary Statistics** - Overview of user's skill profile

### Step 7: Implement Compatibility Service âœ…

- **CompatibilityAnalyzer** service fully implemented with:
  - Exact skill matching against normalized skill database
  - Similar skill detection using `SkillSimilarity` relationships
  - Proficiency level comparison with scoring penalties
  - Years of experience analysis with configurable thresholds
  - Education requirement matching with flexible level mapping
  - Weighted overall scoring (60% skills, 30% experience, 10% education)
  - Intelligent recommendation generation

### Step 8: Enhanced Tools Integration âœ…

- Updated `compare_skills_to_job` tool to use `CompatibilityAnalyzer`
- Integrated compatibility analysis into AI agent workflows
- Job posting manager can now provide detailed skill analysis

- Supports both old string arrays and new normalized models
- Gradual migration path preserves existing data

### Data Migration

- Skills seeded from common technology taxonomies
- Existing work skills can be imported to new `UserSkill` model
- Job posting requirements parsed and normalized automatically

### Performance

- Indexed skill matching queries for fast analysis
- Efficient similarity scoring algorithms
- Optimized database relationships for scalability

This implementation provides a solid foundation for sophisticated job-skill matching while maintaining excellent user experience and performance. Users can now get instant, detailed feedback on their compatibility with any job posting, along with actionable recommendations for improvement.
