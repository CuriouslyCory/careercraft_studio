# Conversations Feature Implementation

## Overview

Added a comprehensive conversation management system to Resume Master that allows users to:

- View all their conversations in a dedicated panel
- Rename conversations with custom names
- Delete conversations they no longer need
- Load specific conversations into the chat interface
- Create new conversations

## Database Changes

### New Model: ChatDetails

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `conversationId`: Unique conversation identifier (links to ChatMessage)
- `name`: User-defined conversation name (defaults to "New Conversation")
- `createdAt`: When the conversation was created
- `updatedAt`: Last activity timestamp
- `userId`: Owner of the conversation

### Updated Model: ChatMessage

- Added foreign key relationship to `ChatDetails` via `conversationId`
- Messages now properly cascade delete when conversations are deleted
