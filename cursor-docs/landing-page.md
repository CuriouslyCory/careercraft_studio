# Landing Page Design & Architecture

This document outlines the design decisions, technical architecture, and user experience strategy for the CareerCraft Studio landing page.

## Overview

The landing page serves as the primary marketing and conversion tool for CareerCraft Studio, designed to communicate the product's value proposition and guide users toward sign-up or immediate engagement with the platform.

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` (server component) and `src/app/_components/landing-page-client.tsx` (client component)

## Design Philosophy

### Brand Identity & Color Scheme

**Primary Color Palette:**

- **Indigo/Blue Gradient**: Professional, trustworthy, and tech-forward
  - Primary: `from-indigo-900 via-blue-900 to-slate-900`
  - Accents: `from-blue-600 to-indigo-600`
  - Light variants: `from-slate-50 via-blue-50 to-indigo-100`

**Color Psychology:**

- **Blue**: Trust, professionalism, stability - essential for career-related products
- **Indigo**: Innovation, intelligence, depth - reflects AI-powered capabilities
- **Gradient Approach**: Modern, dynamic, suggesting transformation and progress

**Typography & Visual Hierarchy:**

- Large, bold headlines with gradient text effects for impact
- Clean, readable body text with proper contrast ratios
- Consistent spacing and typography scale for professional appearance

### User Experience Strategy

**Target Audience:**

- Job seekers across all industries and experience levels
- Professionals looking to optimize their application materials
- Users frustrated with generic, one-size-fits-all resume tools

**Value Proposition Hierarchy:**

1. **Primary**: AI-powered personalization that adapts to every job opportunity
2. **Secondary**: Time-saving automation with professional results
3. **Tertiary**: Comprehensive feature set covering entire job search workflow

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

**Server-Client Separation:**

```typescript
// src/app/page.tsx (Server Component)
export default async function Home() {
  const session = await auth();
  return (
    <HydrateClient>
      <LandingPageClient session={session} />
    </HydrateClient>
  );
}

// src/app/_components/landing-page-client.tsx (Client Component)
export function LandingPageClient({ session }: LandingPageClientProps) {
  // Animation logic and interactive elements
  // Routes authenticated users to /dashboard as primary interface
}
```

**Benefits of This Architecture:**

- **Server-side Authentication**: Secure session handling with Next.js App Router
- **Client-side Animations**: Motion.js animations without hydration issues
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for session data
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering for SEO with client-side interactivity

### Animation Strategy

**Motion.js Integration:**

- **Hero Animations**: Staggered entrance effects for title, subtitle, and CTA
- **Feature Cards**: Scroll-triggered animations with stagger effects
- **Stats Section**: Scale animations for impact metrics
- **Performance**: Lightweight animations that enhance rather than distract

**Animation Timing:**

```typescript
// Hero sequence
animate(
  ".hero-title",
  { opacity: [0, 1], y: [50, 0] },
  { duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },
);
animate(
  ".hero-subtitle",
  { opacity: [0, 1], y: [30, 0] },
  { duration: 0.8, delay: 0.4 },
);
animate(
  ".hero-cta",
  { opacity: [0, 1], y: [20, 0] },
  { duration: 0.8, delay: 0.6 },
);

// Staggered feature cards
animate(
  ".feature-card",
  { opacity: [0, 1], y: [30, 0] },
  { delay: stagger(0.1), duration: 0.6 },
);
```
