# Agent Loop Control & Duplicate Prevention

This document outlines the plan to improve the agent team's loop control mechanisms, prevent duplicate tool calls, and add clarification capabilities to reduce assumptions.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Tool Calls âœ… FIXED

- **Problem**: The `processJobPostingToolCalls` function automatically stores parsed job postings even when not explicitly requested, leading to potential duplicates
- **Location**: Lines 1247-1264 in `agentTeam.ts`
- **Impact**: Users may see "Auto-stored: Job posting already exists" messages repeatedly
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Duplicate detection implemented

### 2. Lack of Clarification âœ… FIXED

- **Problem**: Agents assume user intent instead of asking for clarification when multiple actions are possible
- **Example**: When user posts "Job post: <text>", the system automatically parses and stores instead of asking what the user wants to do
- **Impact**: Poor UX and potential unwanted actions
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Clarification system implemented

### 3. No Loop Termination Awareness âœ… FIXED

- **Problem**: Agents don't track previous actions in the conversation loop to avoid redundant operations
- **Impact**: Inefficient processing and confusing user experience
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Loop control implemented

### 4. Job Posting Parse/Store Separation ðŸ”„ NEW ISSUE

- **Problem**: Job posting parsing and storing are separate actions, causing workflow confusion
- **Current Behavior**:
  - `parse_job_posting` extracts data but doesn't store it
  - Returns a message asking user what to do next
  - Supervisor tries to re-parse the extracted summary instead of using original content
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - `parse_job_posting` should extract data AND store it automatically
  - Should return confirmation of both parsing and storage
  - Should eliminate the need for separate `store_job_posting` calls
- **Impact**: Poor UX, workflow confusion, supervisor routing errors

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Add State Tracking âœ… PLANNED

#### 1.1 Extend Agent State

```typescript
const AgentState = Annotation.Root({
  messages: Annotation<BaseMessage[]>({
    reducer: (x, y) => x.concat(y),
    default: () => [],
  }),
  next: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (x, y) => y ?? x ?? END,
    default: () => "supervisor",
  }),
  userId: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (x, y) => y ?? x ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  // NEW: Track completed actions to prevent duplicates
  completedActions: Annotation<CompletedAction[]>({
    reducer: (x, y) => [...x, ...y],
    default: () => [],
  }),
  // NEW: Track pending clarifications
  pendingClarification: Annotation<PendingClarification | null>({
    reducer: (x, y) => y ?? x,
    default: () => null,
  }),
});
```

#### 1.2 Define Action Tracking Types

```typescript
interface CompletedAction {
  id: string;
  agentType: string;
  toolName: string;
  args: Record<string, unknown>;
  result: string;
  timestamp: number;
  contentHash?: string; // For content-based deduplication
}

interface PendingClarification {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  options: ClarificationOption[];
  context: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface ClarificationOption {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  action: {
    agentType: string;
    toolName: string;
    args: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
}
```

### Phase 2: Implement Duplicate Detection âœ… PLANNED

#### 2.1 Create Deduplication Utilities

```typescript
// NEW: Utility functions for duplicate detection
function createContentHash(content: string): string;
function isDuplicateAction(
  newAction: Omit<CompletedAction, "id" | "timestamp">,
  completedActions: CompletedAction[],
): CompletedAction | null;
function shouldSkipToolCall(
  toolCall: ValidatedToolCall,
  completedActions: CompletedAction[],
): { skip: boolean; reason?: string; existingAction?: CompletedAction };
```

#### 2.2 Update Tool Call Processing

- Modify `processJobPostingToolCalls` to check for duplicates before execution
- Remove automatic storage logic
- Add duplicate detection for all tool processors

### Phase 3: Add Clarification Mechanism âœ… PLANNED

#### 3.1 Create Clarification Tools

```typescript
// NEW: Supervisor tool for requesting clarification
const requestClarificationTool = {
  name: "request_clarification",
  schema: z.object({
    question: z.string(),
    options: z.array(
      z.object({
        id: z.string(),
        label: z.string(),
        description: z.string(),
        agentType: z.string(),
        toolName: z.string(),
        args: z.record(z.unknown()),
      }),
    ),
    context: z.record(z.unknown()).optional(),
  }),
};
```

#### 3.2 Update Supervisor Logic

- Add clarification detection patterns
- Modify routing to request clarification when multiple actions are possible
- Handle clarification responses

### Phase 4: Implement Loop Control âœ… PLANNED

#### 4.1 Add Recursion Limits

```typescript
const AGENT_CONFIG = {
  // ... existing config
  LOOP_LIMITS: {
    MAX_AGENT_SWITCHES: 10,
    MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_AGENT: 5,
    MAX_CLARIFICATION_ROUNDS: 3,
  },
} as const;
```

#### 4.2 Track Loop Metrics

- Count agent switches per conversation
- Track tool calls per agent per loop
- Monitor clarification rounds

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Job Posting Clarification

**User Input**: "Job post: Software Engineer at Google..."

**Current Behavior**:

- Automatically parses and stores the job posting

**New Behavior**:

- Supervisor requests clarification: "I see you've shared a job posting. Would you like me to:
  1. Parse and store it for future reference
  2. Compare it to your skills
  3. Just analyze the requirements
  4. All of the above"

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Prevention

**User Input**: "Parse this job posting again: [same content]"

**Current Behavior**:

- Parses and attempts to store, gets "already exists" error

**New Behavior**:

- Detects duplicate content
- Responds: "I've already parsed this job posting. Would you like me to show you the previous analysis or compare it to your skills?"

### Scenario 3: Loop Control

**User Input**: Multiple rapid requests that could cause loops

**Current Behavior**:

- May process indefinitely or until error

**New Behavior**:

- Tracks loop metrics
- Terminates gracefully when limits reached
- Suggests alternative approaches

## Files to Modify

1. **`src/server/langchain/agentTeam.ts`** - Main agent logic
2. **`src/server/langchain/tools/`** - Tool implementations
3. **`cursor-docs/ai-chat.md`** - Update documentation to reflect dashboard integration
4. **`cursor-docs/job-posting-import.md`** - Update workflow documentation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work
2. **Performance**: Monitor impact of state tracking on performance
3. **User Experience**: Ensure clarifications don't become annoying
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of edge cases
